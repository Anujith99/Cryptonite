## About the Project

I have been learning React for a few months now and decided to implement my existing knowledge  as well as learn new concepts by building
this project. I decided to build a website as I can exhibit basic React  and development skills. I use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) 
for the project setup and the project was deployed on Netlify.  Some of the lessons I learnt during this process are:

- [SASS](https://github.com/sass/sass), specifically how to use variables, mixins and nesting.
- Using [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) to work with an immutable state.
- Building custom components like an accordion, responsive navbar, loading skeletons, etc..
- How to work with public APIs. For the latest articles I used the GNews API, for videos  
  I used the Youtube API and for podcasts I used the Apple Music search API.
- Building custom modals with React portals.
- Building beautiful graphs with [Recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts).
- Building custom slider with the help of [React-Slick](https://github.com/akiran/react-slick).
- And much more...

## Conclusion

It is definitely not a perfect project but it is a start. I've learned so  much while building this project and I'm happy that I could escape tutorial
hell. I'm looking forward to building more projects and hopefully adding more features to this project.
